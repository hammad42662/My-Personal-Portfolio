          I’m a Software Developer with nearly two years of experience
          specializing in front-end development and fundamental knowledge of
          backend technologies. Over the past year as a Freelance Web Developer,
          I’ve created visually engaging and user-friendly websites for various
          clients. Previously, I spent eight months at Convent Generation IT as
          a Junior Web Developer, where I worked on responsive web pages and
          collaborated closely with senior developers on key projects. I’m
          passionate about building seamless digital experiences and am
          committed to delivering high-quality work that meets both client and
          user needs.
