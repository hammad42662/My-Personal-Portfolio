            I’m a Software Developer with nearly two years of experience
            specializing in front-end development and a solid foundation in
            backend technologies. Over the past year as a Freelance Web
            Developer, I’ve created visually engaging and user-friendly websites
            for various clients. Previously, I spent eight months at Convent
            Generation IT as a Junior Web Developer, where I worked on
            responsive web pages and collaborated closely with senior developers
            on key projects. I’m passionate about building seamless digital
            experiences and am committed to delivering high-quality work that
            meets both client and user needs.
